Mural:&nbsp;<a href="http://andrealikes.to/">Andrea Nguyen</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.jeanyngo.com/">Jeany Ngo</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.katiechen.design/">Katie Chen</a></h6><p></p><p>In 2012, shortly after&nbsp;Airbnb&nbsp;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2012/12/13/airbnb-acquires-localmind/">acquired</a>&nbsp;our&nbsp;startup, I&nbsp;overheard&nbsp;co-founder Joe Gebbia giving guidance to a&nbsp;designer&nbsp;tasked&nbsp;with redesigning the homepage.&nbsp;He said,&nbsp;“Build&nbsp;something&nbsp;the internet has never seen before.”&nbsp;I&nbsp;vividly&nbsp;remember thinking,&nbsp;<em>What does that even mean?&nbsp;And&nbsp;is this&nbsp;the bar for&nbsp;everything around here?</em>&nbsp;Looking back, I’ve come to recognize that this&nbsp;mindset&nbsp;has been one of the key ingredients in Airbnb’s historic growth.</p><p>I first&nbsp;joined&nbsp;Airbnb as an engineer, then became one of the first members of the&nbsp;budding&nbsp;PM team. Back then, there were a couple&nbsp;dozen&nbsp;engineers, a few designers, and two very cute dogs.&nbsp;Over&nbsp;the next seven years, as the company scaled to thousands of global employees,&nbsp;countless cute dogs, and&nbsp;over $30 billion in value, I took on a lot of interesting&nbsp;problems&nbsp;and worked with many incredible&nbsp;people.&nbsp;Since leaving a few weeks ago, I’ve been&nbsp;jotting&nbsp;down my biggest lessons from these experiences. I’ve&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/kylemeyer/status/566366186389004288?s=21">realized</a>&nbsp;I should share these lessons with anyone else working to build a company. I can’t promise they will all apply to your situation, but they have been core to Airbnb’s success.</p><h1>Create strong culture, values, and&nbsp;rituals</h1><p>It’s&nbsp;increasingly&nbsp;common&nbsp;for&nbsp;people&nbsp;to&nbsp;choose companies that connect with their&nbsp;personal values,&nbsp;both as&nbsp;consumers&nbsp;and employees.&nbsp;From day one, Airbnb&nbsp;has&nbsp;been a&nbsp;company&nbsp;obsessed&nbsp;with&nbsp;strong culture, clear values,&nbsp;and quirky&nbsp;rituals.&nbsp;Over&nbsp;the years, I’ve witnessed&nbsp;how effective this has been in creating a competitive advantage,&nbsp;allowing the company to&nbsp;hire&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/03/06/greg-greeley-former-amazon-prime-vp-moves-to-airbnb-homes.html">the</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://hbr.org/2017/04/i-joined-airbnb-at-52-and-heres-what-i-learned-about-age-wisdom-and-the-tech-industry">best</a> <a href="https://press.airbnb.com/fred-reid-joins-airbnb-as-global-head-of-transportation/">talent</a>, move quickly&nbsp;when&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/05/technology/airbnb-super-bowl-ad-trump-travel-ban.html">opportunities</a>&nbsp;arise,&nbsp;and push through&nbsp;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2011/08/01/airbnb-offers-unconditional-apology-and-50000-insurance-guarantee/">adversity</a>. Most importantly, it has made it&nbsp;easy&nbsp;for leaders to&nbsp;stay true to the long-term mission&nbsp;and for the team to&nbsp;hold&nbsp;them accountable.</p><p>How did Airbnb create a&nbsp;strong&nbsp;culture?&nbsp;Three key&nbsp;ingredients:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Founders&nbsp;obsessed with culture.</strong>&nbsp;<a href="https://medium.com/@bchesky/dont-fuck-up-the-culture-597cde9ee9d4">See Exhibit A</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfWgVWGEuGE">Exhibit B</a>. This is fundamental, especially as you scale.&nbsp;It influences who your first few hires are (who&nbsp;co-create&nbsp;the culture) and the values you model (knowingly&nbsp;or unknowingly).</p></li><li><p><strong>A strong sense of self.</strong>&nbsp;Airbnb did this through a&nbsp;codified&nbsp;set of core values&nbsp;created by a small task force about three years in.&nbsp;Airbnb uses these core values when measuring success&nbsp;(are we achieving our mission?),hiring&nbsp;(a core values interview group vets all candidates),&nbsp;evaluating performance&nbsp;(it’s baked into the&nbsp;peer-review process), and&nbsp;looking at large deals.&nbsp;Everyone at the company can recount the values&nbsp;verbatim.</p></li><li><p><strong>Rituals.</strong>&nbsp;Cookie time Tuesdays. New hire tea time. Hosted bar. Human tunnels. Fun facts.&nbsp;Silly but regular rituals create space for employees to strengthen bonds and bring joy to the workplace.&nbsp;Don’t overthink your rituals; experiment and see what&nbsp;sticks.</p></li></ul><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" target="_blank"

you get started in building your own culture and values.</p><p><strong>Main takeaway:</strong>&nbsp;Be&nbsp;obsessed&nbsp;with your company (and team) culture.</p><h1><strong>Nail the problem statement</strong></h1><p>Crafting&nbsp;and&nbsp;aligning&nbsp;on a problem&nbsp;statement&nbsp;is the single&nbsp;most important step in solving any problem.&nbsp;I’ve consistently seen&nbsp;simple projects with&nbsp;vague problem statements go in circles for weeks and months,&nbsp;while&nbsp;complex projects with strong problem statements sail smoothly.</p><p>A few key tools that I’ve found helpful:</p><ul><li><p>This&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1541V32QgSwyCFWxtiMIThn-6n-2s7fVWztEWVa970uo/edit">one-pager template</a>&nbsp;is something I’ve&nbsp;refined&nbsp;over the years to crystallize&nbsp;the problem and opportunity for my team and stakeholders.</p></li><li><p>The&nbsp;situation-complication-resolution&nbsp;<a href="https://speakingsherpa.com/how-to-tell-a-business-story-using-the-mckinsey-situation-complication-resolution-scr-framework/">framework</a>&nbsp;is extremely helpful in communicating the story to a wider audience.</p></li><li><p>The jobs-to-be-done&nbsp;<a href="https://jtbd.info/2-what-is-jobs-to-be-done-jtbd-796b82081cca">framework</a>&nbsp;helps ensure you’re&nbsp;addressing&nbsp;real customer needs.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Main takeaway:</strong>&nbsp;Obsess over crystallizing the problem you are trying to solve and&nbsp;align your entire&nbsp;team&nbsp;behind&nbsp;it.</p><h1>Set wildly ambitious goals</h1><p>At the end of each year, we were often shocked at how close we came to hitting our&nbsp;wildly ambitious, seemingly impossible goals.&nbsp;And when I say wildly ambitious, I’m making an&nbsp;understatement — Brian, Airbnb’s CEO, is (in)famous for doubling our proposed goals, and often pushing us to 10 times the goal.&nbsp;This&nbsp;ambitious approach has pushed teams to think bigger and rise to the occasion.</p><p>Five key ingredients to doing this well:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Set&nbsp;uncomfortable goals.</strong>&nbsp;Our&nbsp;approach was to pick a goal that made us uncomfortable,&nbsp;while also clearly understanding why hitting it would be incredible for the business.&nbsp;Two questions we asked were&nbsp;1)&nbsp;What would need to be true for us to hit this goal?&nbsp;and&nbsp;2) What could we accomplish without barriers (budget, people, dependencies, etc.)?</p></li><li><p><strong>Make sure someone is&nbsp;directly accountable.</strong>&nbsp;Hitting this goal needs to be an individual person’s job.&nbsp;If a number doesn’t have a person’s name next to it, it’s not going to happen.</p></li><li><p><strong>Think long-term.</strong>&nbsp;We generally looked ahead five to 10 years in order determine that year’s goal, both in terms of growth and our mission. Though we didn’t always&nbsp;nail&nbsp;it, we’ve increasingly put a lot of thought into the impact our work has on the many&nbsp;stakeholders&nbsp;we serve, which was recently&nbsp;crystallized&nbsp;by Brian in an&nbsp;<a href="https://press.airbnb.com/brian-cheskys-open-letter-to-the-airbnb-community-about-building-a-21st-century-company/">open letter</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Give a&nbsp;cross-functional team ownership&nbsp;of how to achieve the goal.</strong>Your number-one job as a leader is to assemble the right team, point team members in the right&nbsp;direction, and stay&nbsp;vigilant&nbsp;in unblocking them.</p></li><li><p><strong>Celebrate success, don’t punish failure.</strong>&nbsp;Follow through on the original intent of the goal — it was meant to push you, not kill you.&nbsp;If you don’t hit the goal but get close, congratulate the team and move on to the next goal.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Main takeaway:</strong>&nbsp;When setting goals, think bigger.</p><h1>Start&nbsp;with the ideal and work&nbsp;backward</h1><p>A variation of&nbsp;Amazon’s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.quora.com/What-is-Amazons-approach-to-product-development-and-product-management?ref=http://www.product-frameworks.com/">working backward methodology</a>&nbsp;that I’ve seen work exceptionally&nbsp;well at Airbnb&nbsp;starts&nbsp;with envisioning the perfect user experience.&nbsp;A classic example was a project code-named Snow White.Inspired by the approach Disney took in developing the original&nbsp;<em>Snow White </em>film,&nbsp;the founders began looking at Airbnb not as just a website or a service, but as a story with a beginning, middle, and end.</p><p><em>Snow White</em>&nbsp;was one of the first films to use&nbsp;the technique of storyboards, and thus the team&nbsp;developed a set of storyboards of the ideal guest and host experience,&nbsp;identifying key emotional moments along that journey.&nbsp;These storyboards quickly became a key tool in identifying our biggest gaps and opportunities, and informed the early company strategy.

The process at that point had many steps, including a waiting period while the host reviewed the request.&nbsp;Instead of spending months or years micro-optimizing individual parts of the funnel, we stepped back and explored what the ideal booking experience would look like.</p><p>In this case, it was unquestionably a guest being able to instantly book any home without having to wait.&nbsp;Initially, it seemed impossible to convince every host to allow guests to book without approval. (Only about 5% of bookings were instant at that time.) Nonetheless, it became clear that this was where our business needed to go long-term, so we put all of our team’s resources behind this bet.&nbsp;Over the course of a couple of years, we transformed the marketplace to where the vast majority of bookings are now instant.</p><p>A few key ingredients to this process:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Write or&nbsp;draw out what the ideal experience looks like, feels like.</strong>&nbsp;In our case, before diving into any short-term optimizing,&nbsp;we sketched out the ideal booking flow on paper and&nbsp;wrote a sample blog post to describe what we’d announce if this were to become real.</p></li><li><p><strong>Create a framework.&nbsp;</strong>To make the problem more tractable, break it down into manageable chunks.&nbsp;In the case of instant book, the biggest gap was giving our hosts more control over who could book their home instantly.&nbsp;We broke that gap into two types of problems: “can” problems (am I able to use it?)&nbsp;and “want” problems (do I want to use it?), then worked through them in priority order.</p></li><li><p><strong>When it feels uncomfortable, get more data.&nbsp;</strong>A change this significant is often scary for your colleagues or users. Before you give up, look at actual data.&nbsp;Validate your assumptions through a quick experiment, user research, or historical data.&nbsp;As one data point, many people internally and externally assumed a trip booked instantly would lead to a lower-quality experience (less communication, more transactional), hurting long-term growth. A quick data dive showed otherwise, and that, along with a few other key data points, cleared the path for internal buy-in.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Main takeaway:</strong>&nbsp;Look for opportunities to make a&nbsp;step-function change&nbsp;by imagining the ideal state and working backward from that.</p><h1>Think of your org design as a&nbsp;product</h1><p>As you move up the ranks of leadership at a product org,&nbsp;you quickly learn&nbsp;the most important product to get right is how you organize your people.&nbsp;How you structure your org can be a force multiplier&nbsp;or a hindrance to achieving your mission.</p><p>There are a number of key ingredients to successful org design:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Optimize for dedicated cross-functional teams with a&nbsp;clear&nbsp;mandate. </strong>In my experience, this is the single most impactful thing leaders can do when setting up a team.&nbsp;You want self-contained teams that can move autonomously&nbsp;toward an agreed-upon goal.&nbsp;Any missing resource (designer, DS, budget), additional cross-team dependency, or conflicting surface area cuts the team’s impact&nbsp;immensely.&nbsp;(This is often invisible until later.)&nbsp;Minimize the number of times a team will need to meet with or wait for another team.&nbsp;Well-functioning teams feel like a black box that outputs regular updates and amazing work.</p></li><li><p><strong>Get the goals right.</strong>&nbsp;A lot has been said about goals (for example,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/smart-goals.htm">SMART goals</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/john_doerr_why_the_secret_to_success_is_setting_the_right_goals?language=en">OKRs</a>), but I think teams still underestimate&nbsp;the power of getting goals right.&nbsp;Setting the right goal can be the difference between incredible progress and unending churn.&nbsp;Goals should 1)&nbsp;be limited in number — ideally just one or two, 2)&nbsp;have quick feedback loops that allow you to see impact immediately, 3) be directly connected to top-line business growth, 4) be easily understood, and 5) be uncomfortable.</p></li><li><p><strong>Be aware that there is no perfect org design.</strong>&nbsp;At Airbnb, I went through almost&nbsp;a dozen reorgs. I’ve never seen a single org plan that addressed every issue and made everyone happy.&nbsp;Make sure you’re addressing the biggest pain points, future-proofing it as much as you can, and then move forward.&nbsp;The plan will have&nbsp;flaws, like overlapping product ownership, two teams with the same key metric, or a team owning far too much. Note the&nbsp;flaws&nbsp;and put systems in place to work around them. Set expectations that the org will change again in the future.</p></li></ul><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc47b2390-f57a-4ecb-a110-68ebf1c869aa_1600x1200.jpeg"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc47b2390-f57a-4ecb-a110-68ebf1c869aa_1600x1200.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc47b2390-f57a-4ecb-a110-68ebf1c869aa_1600x1200.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc47b2390-f57a-4ecb-a110-68ebf1c869aa_1600x1200.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc47b2390-f57a-4ecb-a110-68ebf1c869aa_1600x1200.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/c47b2390-f57a-4ecb-a110-68ebf1c869aa_1600x1200.jpeg" width="1100" height="825" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/c47b2390-f57a-4ecb-a110-68ebf1c869aa_1600x1200.jpeg&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:825,&quot;width&quot;:1100,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc47b2390-f57a-4ecb-a110-68ebf1c869aa_1600x1200.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc47b2390-f57a-4ecb-a110-68ebf1c869aa_1600x1200.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc47b2390-f57a-4ecb-a110-68ebf1c869aa_1600x1200.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc47b2390-f57a-4ecb-a110-68ebf1c869aa_1600x1200.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#FFFFFF" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" y1="3" x2="14" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" y1="21" x2="10" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a><h6>“Use Your Voice”, by&nbsp;<a href="https://shantellmartin.art/">Shantell Martin</a>, drawn free-hand over the course of a day at Airbnb&nbsp;HQ</h6><p></p><p><strong>Main takeaway:</strong>&nbsp;Build autonomous units with well-defined goals and get out of the way.</p><h1>Maintain&nbsp;a high bar for everything</h1><p>Coming from the startup world, I was accustomed to moving quickly, settling for good enough, and thinking short-term.&nbsp;There was always too much to do and too little time. Who knew if the company would even be around in a year? An early manager at Airbnb instilled in me the power of keeping a high bar for my work. Looking back, this one change has profoundly impacted my career.</p><p>How to keep the bar high for yourself and the team around you:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Emails.</strong>&nbsp;Force yourself to look at your email at least once before sending it. There’s always something you can cut or clarify.&nbsp;<a href="https://hbr.org/2016/11/how-to-write-email-with-military-precision">Here’s</a>&nbsp;a style I love, courtesy of the military.</p></li><li><p><strong>Shared docs.</strong>&nbsp;Always ask for feedback from at least one person before sharing a doc widely.&nbsp;Focus on clean and consistent formatting.&nbsp;Close out comments before sharing with execs. Make it easy to scan.&nbsp;Keep pushing yourself to learn to write better.</p></li><li><p><strong>Meetings.</strong>&nbsp;Include the primary goal of the meeting in your invite, ideally along with an agenda. If you attend a meeting that doesn’t feel productive, call it out. Invite as few people as possible.&nbsp;Leave with clear action items. Follow up over email with the action items and owners.</p></li><li><p><strong>Presentations.</strong>&nbsp;Are you sure you need to do a presentation versus an email? Make sure your audience knows the goal of the presentation — are you looking for a decision or general feedback, or purely sharing information? It’s not as obvious as you think.&nbsp;Get feedback on your presentation; fresh eyes always catch the glaring issues. And keep it short — no one has ever wished that presentation went longer.</p></li><li><p><strong>Hiring.</strong>&nbsp;The people you bring in determine the company you become.&nbsp;My advice is to&nbsp;only hire people you feel “hell yes” about. If it’s a maybe, it’s a no.&nbsp;More on this advice&nbsp;<a href="https://sivers.org/hellyeah">here</a>.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Main takeaway:</strong>&nbsp;Ask yourself and your team these questions often:&nbsp;How could we go just a bit&nbsp;bolder?&nbsp;What would it take to make this slightly better?How do we make this meeting a little more productive? How do I make this doc or email a bit crisper?&nbsp;Could I set the bar a little higher?</p><h1>Keep your teams&nbsp;focused</h1><p>When&nbsp;I&nbsp;took over&nbsp;the supply growth team at Airbnb, I found a small team spread across a long funnel.&nbsp;They were seeing wins, but were unable to build real momentum.&nbsp;I’d seen the same thing when I took over a team responsible for improving trip quality.&nbsp;In both cases,&nbsp;reducing the problem space and providing a more focused mandate resulted in gains in impact and morale. Aim for teams to have a focused problem to rally around and obsess about.</p><p>In the case of supply growth,&nbsp;our solution was to first divide the team into focused units (a team driving referrals, a team owning top-of-funnel organic growth, a team owning performance marketing, etc.), and then grow each team with&nbsp;resources appropriate&nbsp;to that problem space.&nbsp;In the case of trip quality,&nbsp;we dedicated a quarter at a time to a specific aspect of quality (host response rate, guest review rate, etc.). Once we found large opportunity, we doubled down in the subsequent quarter.</p><p>If you apply this lesson to your product,&nbsp;allowing users to focus on the task at hand is one of the most powerful tools in increasing the number of successful user&nbsp;experiences.&nbsp;Some of the biggest guest conversion gains I saw at Airbnb came from simple tweaks that gave users fewer things to&nbsp;think&nbsp;about — things like opening listings in new&nbsp;tabs (avoids getting lost while exploring), extending session length (you don’t need to log in as often), and removing links within the payments flow (avoids distractions).&nbsp;We saw the same thing on the host side, from always having a “recommended” tag when presenting a set of options, to defaulting settings based on host persona, to&nbsp;adding inline tips so users don’t bounce.&nbsp;Don’t underestimate the power of focus.</p><p><strong>Main takeaway:</strong>&nbsp;Focus. Focus. Focus.</p><div><hr></div><p>Thinking back to what Joe suggested to that one designer many years ago, Airbnb truly has&nbsp;built something the internet has never seen before.&nbsp;It’s been an incredible experience watching the company grow and evolve through the years.
